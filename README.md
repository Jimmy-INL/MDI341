# MDI341 Challenge

### Introduction

####  Challenge MDI341 2017-2018
##### Author :  Umut Şimşekli

The goal of this challenge is to develop a binary classification system which tries to detect if an **image contains moustache or not**.    

As opposed to the previous challenge, we will follow a different procedure in this challenge. The challenge will have **two phases**. Please read the below information carefully.  

**In the first phase** of the challenge, you will be provided a **training dataset** which contains the **raw images** and their corresponding **labels**. We will also provide you a **validation dataset**, which only contains the **raw images**. The labes of the validation set will not be provided. In this phase, you will train your system based on this data and the ranking in the challenge webpage will be based on your score obtained on the validation data.

**The second phase** of the challenge will start only **a couple of hours before the deadline**. Within this period, we will provide you the **test set**. You will need to run the algorithm that you developed on the first phase on this dataset and submit your predictions to the challenge webpage. Your **final ranks** will be determined on this dataset. Note that **this phase will only last a couple of hours**, which means that you will not be able to tune your algorithm on this dataset.
